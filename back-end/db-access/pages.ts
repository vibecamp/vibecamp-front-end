        content: '## COMMUNITY VALUES\nWe don’t generally like rules governing behavior, but we’re aware that it’s up to the organizing team to set the tone for vibecamp.\n\nBeyond ‘just vibe, bro’, here are a few things we wanted to tell y’all:\n\nLargely, identifying misconduct will be at the discretion of the org team. We will have people wearing t-shirts marked ‘fae’ onsite who will escalate issues to the org team if necessary. We, the vibecamp org team, reserve the right to ask anyone to leave vibecamp without a refund if we feel it is an appropriate step to take.\n\n### Things that we will have zero tolerance for include:\n\n- acts of physical or sexual assualt (enthusiastic consent and the safety of attendees is VERY important to us)\n- publicly doxxing the names of pseudonymous attendees (don’t be a dick)\n- taking and posting photographs/videos/speech that contain people who have not consented to such (again-don’t be a dick, people)\n\nBy default, respect attendees’ anonymity – don’t take or post pics/videos/transcripts and don’t name or imply names unless everyone involved is on board with you doing so. The Chatham House Rule is a great one for this community – You can talk about what was said or what happened, but don’t make it easy to tell who said/did what unless you have explicit consent. Please don\'t mention Camp Champions in your tweets – only tag @vibecamp_. Oh, and also NO DRUGS! \n\nvibecamp is our baby. We’ve collectively spent hundreds – probably thousands – of hours working to bring this vision to life. We want to be able to hang out with friends old and new, and have a great time together! If any attendees are acting in a way that makes you uncomfortable, please don’t hesitate to bring it to our attention directly, or to a fae volunteer who can contact us. We won’t be able to be everywhere at once and we will do what we can to make this a space where we can all be comfortable in our unique selves.\n\n### So what is it that we do want to see there?\n\nYOU, in all of your glorious weirdness. Wear costumes (or don’t)! Make art! Play, talk, dance, meet new people! Touch grass! Curiosity and kindness are values we stan. We will have a crazy range of viewpoints and political leanings represented among attendees. This is a perfect opportunity to let go of what artificially divides us and meet one another as humans.\n\n### It’s hard to put a finger on our exact values as a community, because we are so diverse and illegible, but here’s our short list:\n\n- participation rather than spectatorship\n- fulfilling conversations\n- illegibility and the ability to go meta\n- gentle, friendly pranksterishness\n- building an IRL home for ingroup\n- using social media to connect people who wouldn’t have met otherwise\n- personal and collective growth\n- deep, meaningful connection\n\nWhile we’re not totally sure what form(s) vibecamp will take over time, we’re sure of a few things. vibecamp is far more than just a bunch of internet strangers getting together for the first time at scale – it is the fulfillment of a dream, a crucial next step along the path towards a better future. We have such incredible people in this community, so much creativity, passion, and talent. Fostering connections between all of us means creating the conditions necessary for amazing people to get together to share thoughts and ideas and begin planning even greater endeavors together.\n\nIn the fullness of time we envision vibecamp moving around the world, spawning regional weekend get-togethers that happen more than once a year, and perhaps eventually culminating in purchasing land for a central event location year round. Stay tuned! Give us feedback! Offer your skills and passion! Create what you want to see! **We can’t do it without you.**',

This phase is over!<br/>\nPhase 2: On December 1st we ran a lottery for all the applicants that did not make it in time for the 1st phase. 150 people were sent ticket purchase links. This phase is over!<br/>\nPhase 3: All remaining applications shall be reviewed by the HIGH COUNCIL. If your application PLEASES the HIGH COUNCIL you shall be granted access. If it DISPLEASES the HIGH COUNCIL you shall be hunted down and sacrificed to the VIBE GODS. This is the current phase!<br/>\nSponsorships: Financial aid is granted on a first-come-first-serve basis. Financial aid is capped at 80 tickets. We may increase this cap in the future. People who have requested financial aid but were not approved will still have a chance to get a ticket purchase link during phase 3.\n\n### Where?\n\nA gorgeous mixed-use site in Maryland, USA. The exact address will be given as we approach the event.\n\n### How much does it cost?\n\n#### Adults and children 9 & older\n\nGeneral admission is $420.69 because we were born of memes and to memes we shall return.  This tier gives you access to the event/activities and covers two meals a day (snacks provided). Your entry pass will allow you to camp in your tent on the grounds, sleep in your car, pass out on the grass, or try and find a cuddle buddy to keep you warm at night.\n\nA cabin ticket is $590. This tier grants you access to everything listed above, AND guarantees you a bed on a tempurpedic mattress in one of the many cabins. Bring your own bedding/sleeping bag/pillow!\n\nFinal Night Celebration tier is $140. This ticket tier gives you event access and food for the final night of the event. You'll check-in on Saturday between 2pm and 6pm and stay the remainder of vibecamp.\n\n#### Kids 8 and under\n\n$210 for a basic ticket<br/>\n$380 for a bed in a cabin\n\nKids 2 and under are free!\n\nAll tickets include food.\n\n### When?\n\nJune 15th-18th 2023\n\n### How do we get there?\n\nRamblewood is near two major cities; Baltimore and Philadelphia. We may be facilitating transportation.

It is not a guarantee to a ticket.\n\n### Refunds?\n\nTicket sales are final. No refunds or cancellations are available.\n\n### Who is going to vibecamp?\n\nCapacity is limited to 800 people for 2023. At the first vibecamp, attendees came mostly from a loose connection of networks on twitter. This included rats, postrats, EAs, burners, tech bros of various stripes, lurkers and people who had never heard of any of those things. The attendees at the first vibecamp were overwhelmingly open, kind, and just downright pleasant to be around. We anticipate that many of those who joined us for the first event will be returning for the second one -- and look forward to the opportunity to make so many more new friends!\n\n### What will happen at vibecamp?\n\nContent and events hosted by both the organizers and attendees like you. As we approach the event we will communicate some of the events you can expect to see.\n\n## ACCOMMODATIONS\n\n### Power Outlets?\n\nYes! There are plenty of power outlets in each cabin as well as at the various other buildings.\n\n### How's data coverage?\n\nPretty good! Most major carriers have decent coverage there.\n\n### Wifi?\n\nHigh speed wifi is available on an as-needed basis. Contact a volunteer or member of the org team to get access.\n\n### Waivers?\n\nTBD. Follow us on Twitter at [@vibecamp_](https://twitter.com/vibecamp_) or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/V6JtaMn7WC) to keep up to date.\n\n### Can I stay in my tent/RV/car?\n\nYep!\n\n### Can I bunk with my friends?\n\nYes! Checkout the communities channels on our [discord](https://discord.gg/V6JtaMn7WC).\n\n### Can I bring my bicycle?\n\nYep! Just make sure to bring a lock!\n\n### Will meals be provided?\n\nYes! The following meals will be provided by on-site services: Thursday dinner, Friday brunch, Friday dinner, Saturday brunch, Saturday dinner, Sunday brunch. Attendees holding single night tickets will be provided Saturday dinner and Sunday brunch. We  plan to organize snacks/light breakfast food for early risers as well.\n\n### What if I have special dietary needs?\n\nIf you’ve purchased a ticket already contact Colby by dming him on twitter ([@zerothaxiom](https://twitter.com/ZerothAxiom)) or emailing him ([colby@vibecamp.xyz](mailto:colby@vibecamp.xyz)).\n\n### Can I bring my own food?\n\nAbsolutely! And even better - at this venue you are allowed to cook it yourself!\n\n### Onsite lockers?\n\nNope!\n\n### Are bedding, towels, and toiletries provided?\n\nBare mattresses are provided in the cabins, and the bathrooms all have toilet paper and soap dispensers next to the sinks.\n\n### Can I bring my child?\n\nYep! See “how much will it cost?” to see child ticket prices. Childcare will not be provided.\n\n### How big are the cabins?\n\nThe cabins are of various sizes.<br/>\nThere are 13 cabins with 7 beds. 2 with 8 beds. 16 with 10 beds. 2 with 12 beds. 4 with 13 beds. 1 with 19 beds. and 1 with 27 beds. We may be reserving a few of these cabins for special purposes.\n\n### STUFF TO BRING\n\n- Clothes for 4 days and 3 nights.\n- A fabulous outfit (or three) for our dance parties\n- Swim gear\n- Your own towel for swimming and showering\n- Flip flops for the showers\n- Toiletries, including sunblock and bug spray\n- Bedding/sleeping bag/pillow.\n- A water bottle.\n- Gifts/schwag/activities/things to share with your friends\n- ~vibes~\n\n## OTHER\n\n### Are pets allowed?\n\nOnly licensed service dogs.\n\n### Can I play music all night long?\n\nThere are no official rules for noise at this venue, but if it’s getting late and you’re bothering other vibers, we will ask you to quiet down.\n\n### Who do I look to for help during vibecamp?\n\nWe will have volunteers on site that will be the point of contact for questions about events or the site, or if you need to contact an organizer  about something more serious. PLEASE report harmful behavior  directly to one of the organizers IMMEDIATELY. We  will have plans in place to respond to issues, but cannot do so if we do not know they are happening.  There will be a single point of contact for interpersonal/community issues and we will  make sure everyone knows how to contact them  to share anonymous complaints as we draw closer to the event.\n\n### How do I contribute to vibecamp?\n\nDo a project or bring content! At the first vibecamp attendees organized art sessions, board games, circling, workshops, dancing, and more. We will soon have a form for you to fill out, letting us know what you want to do at vibecamp. Colby ([@zerothaxiom](https://twitter.com/ZerothAxiom), [colby@vibecamp.xyz](mailto:colby@vibecamp.xyz)) will help you figure out a time and place for your project. Additionally, you can be a volunteer. If you’ve already filled out [this form](https://forms.gle/dCfgaVMTCENgy9mv5) and indicated your interest in volunteering then we may be contacting you about volunteer duty. We also have a donation field on the ticketing page specifically to go into a fund to help sponsor low income attendees, and will be starting a crowdfunding campaign soon to help support the organization as whole.\n\n### Why are tickets more expensive than at the first vibecamp?\n\nThis event includes a whole extra day! The next vibecamp will also be much larger and require a lot more work from the team as well as more resources, EG: portable toilets- plus the org team has some fun surprises planned for attendees we think you’ll be pretty excited about. Ticket prices were so low for the first vibecamp because we didn’t budget in any payments for the people working full or part time on the event.  In order for the event to remain the cool, vision-driven project it has been so far and not have strings attached by outside investors, we needed to bring prices up a bit. We’ll still be working to get as many low-income  people access as we can manage.`,

We see vibefund as a way both to give back, and to invest in our community.

        content: '## VIBEFUND FAQ\n\n### How is this involved with vibecamp?\n\nvibefund is an initiative created by vibecamp LLC, and vibecamp is providing the seed money to make the initial round of funding possible. vibefund was created by the vibecamp organizer team and shares the same overall mission as vibecamp – to capitalize on the social connective potential of the internet to enrich peoples’ real lives.\n\n### Is this a charity?\n\nAlthough we are giving people money, vibecamp LLC isn’t organized as a non-profit or charitable organization. vibefund grants are investments into the community; the return on that investment is a healthier community.\n\n### I need more money, is more available?\n\nWe only have a limited pool of funds for the first round, which is a pilot round to see how well this model of community support works. As vibefund receives donations or secures other funding, future rounds of vibefund grants will become available. We can also offer you advice on seeking grants from other organizations.\n\nIn the meantime, we’re happy to discuss what other support we can offer you besides cash. Our goal is to put all the community’s collective resources at your disposal. vibefund’s philosophy is that support can come in many forms – a dedicated team member who shares your passions and brings new skills to the table might be more valuable than any amount of money.\n\n### What’s the long-term plan here?\n\nvibefund’s real power isn’t the money it can give out, but the connections it can create between people and the centralized, established record of community support and success it will foster. The ‘final form’ of vibefund isn’t just a list of projects, it’s an entire organization dedicated to removing the obstacles between you and your dreams. Skills training, project consulting, job placement, and more are part of vibefund’s mission.\n\n### Where else can I find support?\n\nvibefund isn’t alone.

I acknowledge and fully understand that as a participant, I will be engaging in activities that involve risk of serious injury, including permanent disability and death, property loss and severe social and economic losses. These risks include, but are not limited to, those caused by: (a) the actions, inactions, or negligence of the organizers of the vibecamp Event, i.e., vibecamp LLC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, volunteers, contractors, and/or affiliates (collectively, “Organizers”) and/or participants in the Event; (b) conditions of the premises or equipment used; (c) rules and regulations regarding the activities; (d) temperature; (e) weather; (f) condition of participants; (g) any use by participants and by Organizers of fire, fireworks, and other similar activities; and (h) vehicular traffic. I further acknowledge and fully understand that there may also be other risks that are not known or foreseeable at this time. I KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL RISK OF PROPERTY LOSS, PERSONAL INJURY, SERIOUS INJURY, OR DEATH, WHICH MAY OCCUR BY ATTENDING THE 2023 VIBECAMP EVENT, AND HEREBY FOREVER RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND HOLD ORGANIZERS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM SUCH RISK, EVEN IF ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF ORGANIZERS, OR FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND I ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR MY PARTICIPATION.\n3. I understand that during the vibecamp Event, art installations, theme cabins, events, and performances will be held and/or on display, and I understand that most of these activities are not owned or operated by Organizers. I ASSUME ALL RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH ARISING FROM THE OPERATION OF AND/OR MY PARTICIPATION IN ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THE RELEASE IN SECTION 2 APPLIES TO ANY RELATED INJURY I MIGHT SUSTAIN.\n4. I understand that the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and is an extremely contagious disease that can cause severe illness and death. I understand that this Event is subject to enhanced health and safety measures, and I agree to comply with all health and safety requirements imposed by Organizers or any government agency with jurisdiction over the Event. Despite these enhanced health and safety measures, I understand that there is a risk of exposure to COVID-19 or other communicable diseases at any public gathering like the Event regardless of test/vaccination status. BY ENTERING THE EVENT SITE, I KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE RISK THAT I MAY BE EXPOSED TO OR INFECTED BY COVID-19 OR ANOTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OR ILLNESS, AND/OR THAT I MAY EXPOSE OR INFECT OTHERS, AND THAT SUCH EXPOSURE OR INFECTION MAY RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY, ILLNESS, PERMANENT DISABILITY, AND/OR DEATH. I accept sole responsibility for any claims arising from or related to my participation in the Event, including any exposure to COVID-19 or health requirements at the Event site, and I agree that the waiver of liability and release set forth in Section 5 of these Terms and Conditions applies to any claim relating to COVID-19 or any other communicable disease.\n5. I, on behalf of myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, hereby waive, release, discharge, and agree not to sue Organizers and other participants, sponsors, and if applicable, owners and lessors of equipment, art installations, and premises used to conduct the vibecamp Event or related activities (collectively the “Releasees”), from any and all claims for damages, injuries, losses, liabilities, and expenses that I may have or that may subsequently accrue to me relating to, resulting from, or arising out of my participation in the vibecamp Event, including in any programs, events, art installations, or activities at the Event, and including any injury or damage to my person or property, or to that of any other person or property. If Organizers files a claim against me, however, I may file a counterclaim related to the same facts and circumstances. I agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the Releasees harmless from and against any and all claims by third parties for damages, injuries, losses, liabilities, and expenses relating to, resulting from, or arising out of my participation in the vibecamp Event, including in any programs, events, art installations, or activities at the Event. I intend that the waiver and release of liability contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed broadly to provide a release and waiver to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law.\n6. **vibecamp’s Media Policy.** By entering the vibecamp Event, all participants agree to the following terms, conditions, and guidelines for the use of any imagery obtained at the Event, including still photographs and videos (hereinafter “Event Imagery”). vibecamp treasures the privacy of its attendees, and no Event Imagery containing recognizable facial features of any attendee may be recorded without prior express permission from the attendee. Participants may use Event Imagery for “Personal Use,” defined to include: (1) sharing with friends and family; and (2) displaying on personal websites and social media accounts, provided that neither the Event Imagery nor post text reveals recognizable facial features or individually identifies attendees in any way without their express permission. Participants agree to the following: (1) I will not license for use or publicly display any Event Imagery depicting or suggesting to depict any illegal activity or activity in violation of vibecamp’s guiding principles;  (2) I will not license for use or publicly display any Event Imagery that contains any nudity or partial nudity (including any imagery in which bare breasts, bare buttocks, genitals, or genital areas are visible); and (3) if Organizers notify me that any Event Imagery must be removed from public display, for any reason whatsoever in Organizers’s sole discretion, I will promptly remove or cause to be removed those images. The vibecamp community grows primarily by word of mouth. Organizers do little to solicit attention from media companies about the vibecamp Event, and do not seek to grow the Event by exposure through the mass media. Organizers do continue to support the presence of the press, and to encourage the free expression of news reporters, storytellers, small groups documenting special projects, cultural or fine art photographers, and creative authors/researchers or academics. Any party interested in making any commercial use of their documentation of the Event or in distributing footage beyond Personal Use must, however, enter into a separate written agreement with Organizers.\n7. **vibecamp Trademarks and Copyrights.**  I acknowledge that “vibecamp” and the vibecamp logo/symbol are registered trademarks of Organizers, and that Organizers have the exclusive right to license and enforce those trademarks and copyrights along with its other intellectual property (collectively, “vibecamp Intellectual Property”). WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ORGANIZERS, I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY NOT USE ANY VIBECAMP INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR EVENT IMAGERY IN ANY ADVERTISEMENT OR PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN MUSIC VIDEOS OR IN POSTS ON COMMERCIAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS), OR IN THE TITLE OR ON THE COVER OF ANY PUBLICATION, unless the use is authorized by these Terms and Conditions or constitutes a fair use under United States law. (For general information about trademarks, copyrights, and fair use, please see: [https://ilt.eff.org/Trademark__Liability.html#Fair_Use_Defense](https://ilt.eff.org/Trademark__Liability.html#Fair_Use_Defense) and [https://ilt.eff.org/Copyright__Fair_Use.html](https://ilt.eff.org/Copyright__Fair_Use.html).) Organizers generally permits the use of vibecamp Intellectual Property, without payment of any license fee, on materials that are given away at or in connection with the vibecamp Event (“Gift Materials”), with the following condition: Organizers may, for any reason in their discretion, determine that such use is not in keeping with Organizers’s quality control or  vibecamp’s guiding principles, and if so, all such materials shall no longer be distributed, sold, or exchanged for something of value.\n8. I acknowledge Organizers cannot guarantee universal enforcement of the Media Policy described in Section 6 on all participants at all times, and release Organizers from liability for any Event Imagery containing my likeness that may subsequently be displayed or disseminated by third parties without my consent or payment of compensation to me.\n9. I understand that some participants at the Event may engage in expressive activity and dress contrary to expected societal norms and customs. I agree that such expressive activity and dress is not indecent or offensive to me, and that I have decided to attend the Event with full knowledge that such expressive activity and dress may occur. If I am accompanied by minors at the Event, I acknowledge that I have made a choice that the minors may be exposed to the expressive activities and dress that take place at the Event, and that I have exercised parental responsibility and control in bringing the minors to the Event. Should I find that any activity at the Event is offensive to me, or to any minors accompanying me, I acknowledge that I can avoid such activity by, among other things, leaving the vicinity of the activity or leaving the Event.\n10. I understand that children under 18 years of age may attend the Event only accompanied by a parent or guardian, and if I bring a minor to the Event, I agree to the contractual terms contained in these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the minor.\n11. I acknowledge that all vehicles, including trucks, trailers, and recreational vehicles, entering the Event are subject to search by Gate staff for stowaways, animals, guns, fireworks, handheld lasers, or other prohibited items.\n12. I agree to read and abide by any terms communicated via e-mail or Discord to attendees and all information listed in the vibecamp website and my.vibecamp portal.\n13. I consent to have medical treatment that may be deemed advisable in the event of injury, accident, and/or illness during any program, event, or activity at the Event. I release Organizers and all persons participating in any such medical treatment from all responsibility for any such actions.\n14. I agree that Organizers are not liable for acts of God, the weather, health epidemics or pandemics (including worsening of the current COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, protests, or actions taken by government agencies and similar causes. I understand that tickets are nonrefundable even if the Event is terminated early or canceled, or entry conditions are modified, due to weather, acts of nature, governmental regulation, the failure to obtain required governmental permits, or conditions beyond Organizers’ control.\n15. I understand that (a) I must purchase a cabin ticket or book separate overnight accommodations or source my own tent, sleeping bag, or other safe, survival ground-based sleeping arrangement; (b) guns, rockets, and other explosives are prohibited; (c) personal fireworks of any kind are prohibited; (d) handheld lasers of any kind are prohibited; (e) food, beverages, and cooking equipment or supplies must be securely stored in sealed vehicles or containers when not in use; (f) this is a LEAVE NO TRACE, pack it IN, pack it OUT event.\n16. I understand that commercial activities of any kind, including without limitation delivering goods or services to or at the Event for a prepaid fee, or engaging in marketing or brand promotion at the Event, are expressly prohibited, except as authorized in advance by Organizers.\n17. Tickets are revocable licenses that may be revoked by Organizers for any reason, including without limitation resale for above the price at which they were initially offered by Organizers, plus applicable taxes and Organizers-approved fees (“Face Value”), purchasing more than stated limits, assisting people with unauthorized or un-ticketed entry to the Event, or failure to satisfy the health check requirements described in Section 1. I understand and agree that I may not post or display on any websites or social media accounts any photographs or videos of tickets that display a QR code.\n18. **Refund and Cancellation Policy.**  ALL SALES ARE FINAL. No refunds or exchanges will be issued for any reason. Fees are non-refundable.\n19. **Ticket Sales and Registration for Ticket Sales.**  Pursuant to a series of ticket sale registration processes, a limited number of Event tickets will be made available for sale. Individuals will have an opportunity to register for each sale for which they are eligible via their validated my.vibecamp profile (linked to their Twitter account or e-mail address), and at the end of such registration or later via email, will receive an access code or access information to access the relevant sale. I understand that I will be informed of the applicable procedures for the ticket sale during my registration for that sale, and that by my registration, I agree to be bound by those procedures and to waive any right to challenge the procedures of the registration or the sale. During the registration period for a ticket sale, I may register for an opportunity to purchase tickets, but I understand that my registration does not guarantee me the right to purchase any tickets. Only one registration per person per sale is allowed. If a person registers more than once, all registrations by that person may be canceled without notice. Any registration deemed to be duplicative or potentially fraudulent will be deactivated and blocked from all future sales. Registrations may not be bought or sold under any circumstances, and any registrations discovered to have been purchased or sold will be deactivated and blocked from all future sales. Registrations created using email addresses from disposable domains or “dark mail” providers, or via any other technological means intended to circumvent these Terms and Conditions, are subject to cancellation in the sole discretion of Organizers. At some time after the end of the registration period, I will be able to access the site for ticket purchases on a first-come, first-served basis. I understand that an online queue system may be used and, at Organizers’ discretion, randomization may occur. Once through any queue, I understand that I will be able to purchase tickets only if tickets are available at the time I access the ticket purchase site. I understand that ticket buying limits and restrictions for each sale will be stated on vibecamp.xyz, and I agree to be bound by those limits and restrictions in any sale in which I participate. I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY NOT PURCHASE MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TICKETS PERMITTED AT ANY PRICE LEVEL, AND IF I ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER, ALL MY TICKET ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED, RESCINDED, AND REVOKED AND THE TICKETS VOIDED WITHOUT NOTICE OR REFUND. As part of the ticket purchase process, I understand that I must provide current contact information and a valid debit or credit card. Invalid debit or credit card numbers will be disqualified from participation, and I understand that I will NOT have an opportunity to provide a secondary form of payment. If I successfully purchase tickets, my debit or credit card will be charged automatically for the price of the ticket(s), a per-item and per-transaction service fee, and any applicable taxes and delivery fees. Once I successfully purchase tickets and my debit or credit card is charged, I cannot cancel or withdraw my order, and as with all ticket sales, the sale is final. If my debit or credit card is declined by my financial institution for any reason, the sale to me will not be processed and I will not receive any tickets, or be guaranteed a later opportunity to purchase tickets. Purchase in any sale, even on behalf of someone else, will disqualify me from being awarded a ticket through Organizers’s Sponsorship Program. For any ticket sale or sale registration, if for any reason whatsoever, including computer or software malfunction, mistake or inadvertence, network congestion or crashes, I am not able to purchase any tickets through the sale process, or my registration for a sale or the purchase of tickets is not processed, or I receive a notice that my ticket purchase or ticket registration is rescinded, revoked, canceled, or made in error and my credit card payment is credited to my credit card account, I waive any claim against Organizers and release Organizers from any and all liability. Organizers retains the right to cancel, rescind or revoke any ticket purchases at any time for any reason whatsoever at Organizers’ sole discretion. VIBECAMP EVENT TICKETS MAY NOT BE SOLD FOR ADDITIONAL MARKUP BEYOND THEIR FACE VALUE OR UTILIZED TO PROMOTE OR RAISE FUNDS FOR ANY PROJECT, ENTITY, OR INDIVIDUAL. I understand that if I sell or attempt to sell a vibecamp Event ticket for above Face Value; purchase a ticket with the intention of reselling it for above Face Value; offer a ticket as a reward or prize in any sweepstakes, auction, contest, game, drawing, or fundraising campaign without Organizers’s prior written authorization; or offer a ticket as part of a travel package that includes shelter, meals, or other amenities at the Event, Organizers has the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to cancel all ticket orders in my name without notice. Once cancelled, the ticket will be null and void and will not grant the holder any right to enter the Event, and Organizers will not have any liability to refund any of the purchase price to the purchaser or ticketholder. Organizers does not guarantee the validity of any Event ticket unless it is purchased directly from Organizers or its authorized agents. On request, in extenuating circumstances, Organizers may facilitate purchasers attempting to resell tickets. Organizers may, in their sole discretion, partner with a third party to offer this service. I understand that requesting resale does not guarantee that my ticket will be resold and does not guarantee that I will receive a refund of the ticket purchase price, if there are no individuals who actually purchase my ticket. Once I submit my ticket for resale, I understand that I may not rescind the offer to sell it. Conversely, signing up to express a desire to purchase tickets that may be resold does not guarantee that I will be given the opportunity to buy a ticket through resale.  Organizers do not promise that the ticketing website will be error-free or uninterrupted. The website, content, and service are delivered on an “AS-IS” and “AS-AVAILABLE” basis, and Organizers DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. I AGREE THAT ORGANIZERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE TICKETING WEBSITE OR FROM MY PARTICIPATION IN ANY TICKET SALE OR ACQUISITION PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY ORGANIZERS OR ITS TICKETING PARTNERS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Organizers makes no guarantee of the availability of any tickets or of the ability to purchase tickets from use of the website.\n20. **Cabin Policy.** Cabin beds and facilities are exclusively for the use of attendees holding Cabin Tickets. Attendees without Cabin Tickets agree to refrain from using or attempting to use beds, bathroom facilities, or other cabin amenities without the express permission of all attendees assigned to that cabin. By purchasing a Cabin Ticket, I agree to the following: (1) I understand cabins and their beds have limited availability and Organizers may assign attendees to cabins and beds at their sole discretion; (2) I understand Organizers will attempt to respect Cabin Ticket holders’ preferences about cabin assignments, but will prioritize fair apportionment of beds over individual or group preferences; (3) I understand cabins and their facilities and furniture are the property of Camp Ramblewood and I indemnify Organizers against any damages caused by my abuse or misuse; (4) I accept responsibility for any personal property belonging to other attendees assigned to my cabin that is damaged or lost as a result of intentional or negligent acts undertaken by myself or any of my invitees into my cabin.\n21. **Check-in Process.** To ease the check-in process, I agree to the following: (1) I will bring a phone or other smart device with the ability to access my.vibecamp.xyz over a cellular internet connection to display the QR code for my ticket, OR; (2) I will bring a phone or other smart device with a recently captured screenshot of the QR code for my ticket from my.vibecamp.xyz, OR; (3) I will bring a printout of the QR code of my ticket from my.vibecamp.xyz. I understand Organizers do not guarantee a speedy check-in process for individuals without a QR code at the gate, and I may be asked to wait while others are processed ahead of me if I do not have a QR code.\n22. **Event Ingress and Egress.** Due to the Event’s location, the vehicle capacity limitations of the roads leading to it, and restrictions on maximum population at the Event, I understand that I may be subject to delays in entering and departing the Event. I will be calm and patient during any such delay on the entrance and exit road. I understand that if my vehicle is disabled or abandoned on the road while entering or leaving the Event, my vehicle may be towed out of the traffic lanes, and I expressly release Organizers and its agents from liability for any damage to my vehicle that may result from the towing process.\n23. **Food Service.** Purchase of a ticket includes two buffet-style meals from Camp Ramblewood for each night within the ticket’s admission period. With notice given at ticket purchase or soon after, Organizers will accommodate users with certain dietary restrictions/preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, and dairy-free, and others as Organizers may choose to approve.\n24. These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and enforced according to the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to any rules relating to conflicts of laws. I understand that any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions must be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.\n25. Information provided to Organizers in connection with the purchase of Event tickets is covered by the vibecamp Privacy Policy, available at [http://vibe.camp/privacy-policy/](http://vibe.camp/privacy-policy/). As noted in the vibecamp Privacy Policy, ticket orders are processed in collaboration with independent service providers, and the use of information provided in connection with these transactions is also governed by the privacy policies of those providers.\n26. If I am obtaining tickets for, or providing any tickets to, any other person(s), I recognize that I am acting as that person’s agent in obtaining the tickets, and due to this agency relationship, I agree to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of any person to whom I deliver any of the tickets I obtain, and I shall notify any such person of these Terms and Conditions when I deliver a ticket to them. If I have obtained a ticket from another person, I also agree to these Terms and Conditions when the ticket is delivered to me.\n27. I understand that these Terms and Conditions may be changed by Organizers prior to the Event, and if so, the revised Terms and Conditions will apply to me. The most current version can be found at [https://vibe.camp/terms-and-conditions](/terms-and-conditions) My use of a ticket or other entry credential for entry to the Event signifies my binding agreement to the Terms and Conditions in effect at the time of my entry to the Event.\n\nI ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY, I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS, AND I DO SO KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT OR DURESS.',
