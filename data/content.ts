        content: '## COMMUNITY VALUES\nWe don’t generally like rules governing behavior, but we’re aware that it’s up to the organizing team to set the tone for vibecamp.\n\nBeyond ‘just vibe, bro’, here are a few things we wanted to tell y’all:\n\nLargely, identifying misconduct will be at the discretion of the org team. We will have people wearing t-shirts marked ‘fae’ onsite who will escalate issues to the org team if necessary. We, the vibecamp org team, reserve the right to ask anyone to leave vibecamp without a refund if we feel it is an appropriate step to take.\n\n### Things that we will have zero tolerance for include:\n\n- acts of physical or sexual assualt (enthusiastic consent and the safety of attendees is VERY important to us)\n- publicly doxxing the names of pseudonymous attendees (don’t be a dick)\n- taking and posting photographs/videos/speech that contain people who have not consented to such (again-don’t be a dick, people)\n\nBy default, respect attendees’ anonymity – don’t take or post pics/videos/transcripts and don’t name or imply names unless everyone involved is on board with you doing so. The Chatham House Rule is a great one for this community – You can talk about what was said or what happened, but don’t make it easy to tell who said/did what unless you have explicit consent. Please don\'t mention Camp Champions in your tweets – only tag @vibecamp_. Oh, and also NO DRUGS! \n\nvibecamp is our baby. We’ve collectively spent hundreds – probably thousands – of hours working to bring this vision to life. We want to be able to hang out with friends old and new, and have a great time together! If any attendees are acting in a way that makes you uncomfortable, please don’t hesitate to bring it to our attention directly, or to a fae volunteer who can contact us. We won’t be able to be everywhere at once and we will do what we can to make this a space where we can all be comfortable in our unique selves.\n\n### So what is it that we do want to see there?\n\nYOU, in all of your glorious weirdness. Wear costumes (or don’t)! Make art! Play, talk, dance, meet new people! Touch grass! Curiosity and kindness are values we stan. We will have a crazy range of viewpoints and political leanings represented among attendees. This is a perfect opportunity to let go of what artificially divides us and meet one another as humans.\n\n### It’s hard to put a finger on our exact values as a community, because we are so diverse and illegible, but here’s our short list:\n\n- participation rather than spectatorship\n- fulfilling conversations\n- illegibility and the ability to go meta\n- gentle, friendly pranksterishness\n- building an IRL home for ingroup\n- using social media to connect people who wouldn’t have met otherwise\n- personal and collective growth\n- deep, meaningful connection\n\nWhile we’re not totally sure what form(s) vibecamp will take over time, we’re sure of a few things. vibecamp is far more than just a bunch of internet strangers getting together for the first time at scale – it is the fulfillment of a dream, a crucial next step along the path towards a better future. We have such incredible people in this community, so much creativity, passion, and talent. Fostering connections between all of us means creating the conditions necessary for amazing people to get together to share thoughts and ideas and begin planning even greater endeavors together.\n\nIn the fullness of time we envision vibecamp moving around the world, spawning regional weekend get-togethers that happen more than once a year, and perhaps eventually culminating in purchasing land for a central event location year round. Stay tuned! Give us feedback! Offer your skills and passion! Create what you want to see! **We can’t do it without you.**',

This phase is over!<br/>\nPhase 2: On December 1st we ran a lottery for all the applicants that did not make it in time for the 1st phase. 150 people were sent ticket purchase links. This phase is over!<br/>\nPhase 3: All remaining applications shall be reviewed by the HIGH COUNCIL. If your application PLEASES the HIGH COUNCIL you shall be granted access. If it DISPLEASES the HIGH COUNCIL you shall be hunted down and sacrificed to the VIBE GODS. This is the current phase!<br/>\nSponsorships: Financial aid is granted on a first-come-first-serve basis. Financial aid is capped at 80 tickets. We may increase this cap in the future. People who have requested financial aid but were not approved will still have a chance to get a ticket purchase link during phase 3.\n\n### Where?\n\nA gorgeous mixed-use site in Maryland, USA. The exact address will be given as we approach the event.\n\n### How much does it cost?\n\n#### Adults and children 9 & older\n\nGeneral admission is $420.69 because we were born of memes and to memes we shall return.  This tier gives you access to the event/activities and covers two meals a day (snacks provided). Your entry pass will allow you to camp in your tent on the grounds, sleep in your car, pass out on the grass, or try and find a cuddle buddy to keep you warm at night.\n\nA cabin ticket is $590. This tier grants you access to everything listed above, AND guarantees you a bed on a tempurpedic mattress in one of the many cabins. Bring your own bedding/sleeping bag/pillow!\n\nFinal Night Celebration tier is $140. This ticket tier gives you event access and food for the final night of the event. You'll check-in on Saturday between 2pm and 6pm and stay the remainder of vibecamp.\n\n#### Kids 8 and under\n\n$210 for a basic ticket<br/>\n$380 for a bed in a cabin\n\nKids 2 and under are free!\n\nAll tickets include food.\n\n### When?\n\nJune 15th-18th 2023\n\n### How do we get there?\n\nRamblewood is near two major cities; Baltimore and Philadelphia.

It is not a guarantee to a ticket.\n\n### Refunds?\n\nTicket sales are final. No refunds or cancellations are available.\n\n### Who is going to vibecamp?\n\nCapacity is limited to 800 people for 2023. At the first vibecamp, attendees came mostly from a loose connection of networks on twitter. This included rats, postrats, EAs, burners, tech bros of various stripes, lurkers and people who had never heard of any of those things. The attendees at the first vibecamp were overwhelmingly open, kind, and just downright pleasant to be around. We anticipate that many of those who joined us for the first event will be returning for the second one -- and look forward to the opportunity to make so many more new friends!\n\n### What will happen at vibecamp?\n\nContent and events hosted by both the organizers and attendees like you. As we approach the event we will communicate some of the events you can expect to see.\n\n## ACCOMMODATIONS\n\n### Power Outlets?\n\nYes! There are plenty of power outlets in each cabin as well as at the various other buildings.\n\n### How's data coverage?\n\nPretty good! Most major carriers have decent coverage there.\n\n### Wifi?\n\nHigh speed wifi is available on an as-needed basis. Contact a volunteer or member of the org team to get access.\n\n### Waivers?\n\nTBD. Follow us on Twitter at [@vibecamp_](https://twitter.com/vibecamp_) or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/V6JtaMn7WC) to keep up to date.\n\n### Can I stay in my tent/RV/car?\n\nYep!\n\n### Can I bunk with my friends?\n\nYes! Checkout the communities channels on our [discord](https://discord.gg/V6JtaMn7WC).\n\n### Can I bring my bicycle?\n\nYep! Just make sure to bring a lock!\n\n### Will meals be provided?\n\nYes! The following meals will be provided by on-site services: Thursday dinner, Friday brunch, Friday dinner, Saturday brunch, Saturday dinner, Sunday brunch. Attendees holding single night tickets will be provided Saturday dinner and Sunday brunch. We  plan to organize snacks/light breakfast food for early risers as well.\n\n### What if I have special dietary needs?\n\nIf you’ve purchased a ticket already contact Colby by dming him on twitter ([@zerothaxiom](https://twitter.com/ZerothAxiom)) or emailing him ([colby@vibecamp.xyz](mailto:colby@vibecamp.xyz)).\n\n### Can I bring my own food?\n\nAbsolutely! And even better - at this venue you are allowed to cook it yourself!\n\n### Onsite lockers?\n\nNope!\n\n### Are bedding, towels, and toiletries provided?\n\nBare mattresses are provided in the cabins, and the bathrooms all have toilet paper and soap dispensers next to the sinks.\n\n### Can I bring my child?\n\nYep! See “how much will it cost?” to see child ticket prices.

PLEASE report harmful behavior  directly to one of the organizers IMMEDIATELY. We  will have plans in place to respond to issues, but cannot do so if we do not know they are happening.  There will be a single point of contact for interpersonal/community issues and we will  make sure everyone knows how to contact them  to share anonymous complaints as we draw closer to the event.\n\n### How do I contribute to vibecamp?\n\nDo a project or bring content! At the first vibecamp attendees organized art sessions, board games, circling, workshops, dancing, and more. We will soon have a form for you to fill out, letting us know what you want to do at vibecamp. Colby ([@zerothaxiom](https://twitter.com/ZerothAxiom), [colby@vibecamp.xyz](mailto:colby@vibecamp.xyz)) will help you figure out a time and place for your project. Additionally, you can be a volunteer. If you’ve already filled out [this form](https://forms.gle/dCfgaVMTCENgy9mv5) and indicated your interest in volunteering then we may be contacting you about volunteer duty. We also have a donation field on the ticketing page specifically to go into a fund to help sponsor low income attendees, and will be starting a crowdfunding campaign soon to help support the organization as whole.\n\n### Why are tickets more expensive than at the first vibecamp?\n\nThis event includes a whole extra day! The next vibecamp will also be much larger and require a lot more work from the team as well as more resources, EG: portable toilets- plus the org team has some fun surprises planned for attendees we think you’ll be pretty excited about. Ticket prices were so low for the first vibecamp because we didn’t budget in any payments for the people working full or part time on the event.  In order for the event to remain the cool, vision-driven project it has been so far and not have strings attached by outside investors, we needed to bring prices up a bit. We’ll still be working to get as many low-income  people access as we can manage.`,

        content: '## VIBEFUND FAQ\n\n### How is this involved with vibecamp?\n\nvibefund is an initiative created by vibecamp LLC, and vibecamp is providing the seed money to make the initial round of funding possible. vibefund was created by the vibecamp organizer team and shares the same overall mission as vibecamp – to capitalize on the social connective potential of the internet to enrich peoples’ real lives.\n\n### Is this a charity?\n\nAlthough we are giving people money, vibecamp LLC isn’t organized as a non-profit or charitable organization. vibefund grants are investments into the community; the return on that investment is a healthier community.\n\n### I need more money, is more available?\n\nWe only have a limited pool of funds for the first round, which is a pilot round to see how well this model of community support works. As vibefund receives donations or secures other funding, future rounds of vibefund grants will become available. We can also offer you advice on seeking grants from other organizations.\n\nIn the meantime, we’re happy to discuss what other support we can offer you besides cash. Our goal is to put all the community’s collective resources at your disposal. vibefund’s philosophy is that support can come in many forms – a dedicated team member who shares your passions and brings new skills to the table might be more valuable than any amount of money.\n\n### What’s the long-term plan here?\n\nvibefund’s real power isn’t the money it can give out, but the connections it can create between people and the centralized, established record of community support and success it will foster. The ‘final form’ of vibefund isn’t just a list of projects, it’s an entire organization dedicated to removing the obstacles between you and your dreams. Skills training, project consulting, job placement, and more are part of vibefund’s mission.\n\n### Where else can I find support?\n\nvibefund isn’t alone.
